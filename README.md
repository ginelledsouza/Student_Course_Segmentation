# Student Course Segmentation

# About Research
Online Learning among youth and young professional are very popular, unlike traditional education students have the 
privilege to educate themselves in the comfort of their home. In recent times online education has witnessed a spike, 
thus adding pressure to the educators. They are expected to provide courses that are much more personalized with respected to 
each individual.<br>
This repository is a research that aims at achieving such personalized recommendations by creating groups of individuals that are similar.
For this purpose, we study the **known and unknown variables** i.e. information for a group of 200 students. The knowledge gained can 
help us identify students of similar interest and offer them the best course suited. 

# Literature Survey
- ***Yash Kushwaha and Deepak Prajapati: ”Customer Segmentation using k-means Algorithm”: IJCRT*** <br>
While analyzing and segmenting personalized data considering only the known variables may not give us accurate results.
Thus, we need to consider unknown variables as well to achieve optimal results.

- ***Yanuar Rafi Rahadian and Bambang Syairudin: “Segmenatation Analysis od student in X course with RFM Model and Clustering ”: Jurnal Sosial Humaniora(JSH) 2020, special edition.*** <br>
Segmenting on the bases of unknown variables seems very promising, while a starter company with no be in a position to initially segment their user.

# Methodologies
- ***Clustering Algorithm(K-Means Clustering)***
K-Means Clustering is an Unsupervised Learning algorithm that groups similar dataset into several cluster.
The letter ”K” in K-Means Clustering defines the number of pre-defined  cluster we need to  maintain within the dataset.

- ***RFM(Recency, Frequency, and Monetary) Segmentation:***
RFM is a marketing model that is used to analyze the value of user recency, frequency, and monetary.
It is used to identify  an organization’s best customers based on certain measures.

# Objective
The main objective of the research paper is to provide the user/students with optimal personalized recommendation. Thus, reducing the 
weight off students. This can be achieved through the following.
- Extract complete profile of the user including known and the unknown variables
- Segment the user based on the known variable through k-means clustering.
- Analyze the user unknown variables based on RFM model.
- Segment the user based on the known and unknown variables through k-means clustering

# Conclusion
Every student had their interest and capabilities. Therefore, it makes no sense to offer courses that do not match their 
requirement of individual students. Our research stands as a proposal to educators such that they can provided more custom based or 
personalized courses to their students.
